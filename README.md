# Cooperative multi-robot task allocation using Genetic Algorithm
This is the source code of the Centralized Genetic Algorithm (GA) applied for ST-MR-TA 
(Single task per robot - Multi robots per task - time extended) Multi Robot Task Allocation (MRTA) problem.

To run the program, download all the source code and run "mainGA.m" in MATLAB.
